## 2020 Census — A to Z Perspective

<b>Kaile Bower | U.S. Census Bureau</b>


- Who?
    - Counting every single person the the U.S. and territories
- What?
    - Population and housing characterits
- When?
    - In August start address canvassing
    - Hype should begin in March, when we can start responding
- Data used
    - $675 billion in funding distributed using this data
- How do we make this happen?
    - Where are people living?
    - Spatial data and boundaries are all up to date
- New
    - any location any time can respond through smart phone computer

- not everyone going to respnde
    - Using full scale smart pone techology to collect data from the non responders

- count everyone once only once in the right place


### Four innovation areas

- Geographic programs
    - Buy third-party data on streets
        - National geospatial intelligence agency
    - Partnershp with USPS - delivery sequence files
        - Get this file twice a year
    - Geospatial tech has gotten much better
        - Use this satellite data in office to update and evaluate 70% of the address data

- Field operations
    - Streamlined office and staffing structure
    - Using electronic devices, iphone 8 used for nonresponse follow up activity
    - Optimizer: Looks at where census takers are located and gives census workers the best way to get to census takers homes.
    - When census workers collect data, if they have connectivity it will upload it encrypted and wipe the data from the smart phone
    - Saw 50% increase in productivity i test 
    - 494 down to 248 offices, 600,000 staff down to 450,000 staff or nonresponse follow up

- Field employment and hiring
    - recruiting starts months ahead of time
    - Skills assessment is taken
    - Recruit different language speakers based on areas of the country where it's needed
    - Te think it could be a challenge to hire these people
    - "This is a great part-time job"; a great second job if they have a first one
    - More than 160,000 people created a proflie and completed an assessment on their website

- Responding
    - Three ways: paper, internet, the phone
    - 7% of people will respond throught he phone, 
    - You can go into the respnse tool, say you dont have an ID, and theyll usually be able to match your address
    - Mailing strategy
        - Internet first or Internet choice
            - Internet first - no questionnaire
            - Internet choice - send them a questionnaire too
        - Four cohorts for Internet first
            - Levels out the response so the website doesn't get overloaded

    - If 20% of households might need Spanish assistance they send the letters out in Spanish

- Different approaches for different parts of the country
    - Update leave
        - hand deliver questinnaires without mailboxes
    - Update enumerate
        - for sparesly populatied areas
    - Remote alaska
        - Need to catch tribes before they disperse into hunting camps
        - Meet with tribal leaders and use census takers who speak the language

- Special populations
    - Group quarters
        - Nursing homes or dorms
        - Work with administrators beginning in February
    - Service-based enumeration
        - Missions, runaways, soup kitchens, mobile food vans, and homeless encampents
        - There have been instances when there was suspicion of people using these to fudge the numbers for more apportionment
        - 
    - Transitory
        - RV parks
    - Federal employees positioned overseas
    - Military

- Language program
    - Used ACS data to define what languages are covered
    - 13 languages, from Chinese to Tagalo

- Nonresponse follow up
    - model houses as vacant, nonexistent or occupied
    - enumerator will determine whether they aren't getting an answer because the house isn't occupied
    - stays in the universe if mail is being delivered even if it looks like it might not be occupied
    - Might use administrative data to enumerate 6 million nonresponses
        - Can use this data, like IRS and social security to fill out questions they might have missed
        - Bureau has a way to impute an occupancy status to those units then impute people in them
        - Whole person imputation— "making up people"
        - Critical because the margin in the hoseu of representatives for the last few seats could be really close
            - North Carolina and Utah were very close, NC got the last seat, Utah realied if they took out whole person imputations then wthey wuld get the the seat, they sai imputation was sampling and couldnt be used for apportionment, but Supreme Court decided imputation was it sampling

- Nonresponse follow up procedure
    - Largest non-military mobilization
    - atuomation will help manage staff and case assignment

- Data release schedule
    - Apportionment 
        - 12/31/2020
        - federally afficliated count overseas and resident population
    - Redisctricting data
        - resident only
        - geography and tabi;atopm happen through 2021

- Disclosure avoidance
    - Disclosure Avoidance System assures 2020 data products meet Title 13, section 9 of the U.S. code
    - Modernizing how we protect privacy
    - Don't store much data on phones
    - 

- Snow birds have to say where they live most of the time

- $15.6 billion - 2012 -2022, lifecycle cost of the census
